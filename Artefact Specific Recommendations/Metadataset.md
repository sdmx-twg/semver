| Switch between a Metadataflow reference and a MetadataProvisionAgreement reference | Major | Even if the definitions of the structure are identical, this changes to context of the metadataset and should be treated as a major change. |

## Wildcarding Considerations

Metadatasets can reference other versionable artefacts in their references to a Metadataflow, a MetadataProvisionAgreement, and Target references.

### Metadataflow references

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference to the Metadataflow. |
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding to a Metadataflow. The Metadataset could become invalid because of changes to the Structure of the referenced Metadataflow. |

### MetadataProvisionAgreement references

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with concerns with having a minor wildcard reference to the MetadataProvisionAgreement. |
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding as the Metadataset could become invalid because of changes to the Structure of the referenced MetadataProvisionAgreement. |

### Target references

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference a target. |
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding. The meaning of the Target could change with a major version change of that Target. |
