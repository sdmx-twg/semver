## Wildcarding Considerations

A StructureMap can reference other versionable artefacts in its Source and Taget references as well as it's RepresentationMap reference within its ComponentMap.

### Source References

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 丘멆잺 | With a minor wildcard Elements of the Source may be unmapped. For example, if an optional attribute is added to the Source, it would not be mapped to the Target without changing the StructureMap. |  
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding of Source references. The mapping described by the StructureMap may become invalid, for example with the removal of a dimension in the Source. |

### Target References

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference in a Target reference. |
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding of Target references. The mapping described by the StructureMap may become invalid, for example with the removal of a dimension in the Target. |

### RepresentationMap References within CompotentMaps

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference in a RepresentationMap reference. |  
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding of the RepresentationMap references. Changes to the RepresentationMap can make the CompotentMap invalid, for example by removing a source from the RepresentationMap. |
