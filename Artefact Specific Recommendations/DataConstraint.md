# DataConstraint

**Note:** The SDMX Technical Specifications state:
>"When Data and Metadata Constraints are versioned, the latest version of the Constraint is used to generate the reporting restriction rules; all previous versions are for historical information only."

### Note

If the action results in a more restrictive constraint, then it should be a major change. If the action results in a less restrictive constraint, then it should be a minor change. If the action does not impact the restrictiveness of the constraint, i.e. it is simply a reformulation of the constraint, then it should be a patch.

## Wildcarding Considerations

A DataConstraint can reference other versionable artefacts in their ConstraintAttachment references.
The following are the versionable artefacts which can occur in a ConstraintAttachment:

* DataProvider
* DataStructure
* Dataflow
* ProvisionAgreement  

### Referenced artefact within ConstraintAttachment

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | ‚ö†Ô∏è | If minor wildcarding is used then care should be taken to ensure that the DataConstraint is designed in such a way that there is no concern when new fields are added to the supporting referenced artefact. |  
| Major | üü• | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding of the referenced artefact within ConstraintAttachment. The definition of the constraint may contain elements which are no longer part of the referenced artefact. For example, a Dimension could have been removed from a DataStructure. |
