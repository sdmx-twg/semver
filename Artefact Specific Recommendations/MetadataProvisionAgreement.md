## Wildcarding Considerations

MetadataProvisionAgreement can reference other versionable artefacts with their Metadataflow and MetadataProvider references as well as their Targets.

### Metadataflow references

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference to the Metadataflow. |  
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding to the Metadataflow. The structure of your Metadataflow can change in a way which breaks existing metadata being provided under the MetadataProvisionAgreement. |

### MetadataProvider references

The MetadataProviderScheme is fixed to version 1.0 so wildcarding cannot be applied to this reference.

### Target references

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | 游릭 | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference to a Target. |  
| Major | 游린 | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding to a Target. The meaning of the Target could change with a major version change of that Target. |
