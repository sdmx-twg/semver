## Wildcarding Considerations

ReportingTaxonomyMap can reference other versionable artefacts in their Source and Target ReportingTaxonomy references.

### Source ReportingTaxonomy reference

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | ‚ö†Ô∏è | With a minor wildcard reference new ReportingCategories added to the Source ReportingTaxonomy could be unmapped depending on the ReportingTaxonomy's configuration. |  
| Major | üü• | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding of the Source ReportingTaxonomy. An ItemMap may no longer be valid if its SourceValue was removed from the Source ReportingTaxonomy. |

### Target ReportingTaxonomy reference

| Level |    | Considerations|
|-------|:--:|---------------|
| Minor | üü¢ | There are no concerns with having a minor wildcard reference to a Target ReportingTaxonomy. |  
| Major | üü• | It is not recommended to allow major wildcarding of the Target ReportingTaxonomy. An ItemMap may no longer be valid if its TargetValue was removed from the Target ReportingTaxonomy. |
